/** 
The users table has 1,867 unique user IDs, while the plans_plan table has 1,739, 
which means some users donâ€™t have any plans. Also, the savings table has 873 records,
 showing that not all users with investments have savings.
 So, using an inner join across all three tables makes sense to focus only on users who have data in all of them.
